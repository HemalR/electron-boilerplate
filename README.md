# Demo app

Boilerplate from https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate.git

# What we are trying to demonstrate

1. That electron is not saving files with the extension.
2. That the 'filters' option is not working as it should - on Windows, it shows 'all files' rather than 'pdf' even though this is explicitly provided in the code.
